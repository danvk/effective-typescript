# Item 65: Put TypeScript and @types in devDependencies

## Things to Remember

- Understand the difference between `dependencies` and `devDependencies` in _package.json_.
- Put TypeScript in your project's `devDependencies`. Don't install TypeScript system-wide.
- Put `@types` dependencies in `devDependencies`, not `dependencies`.
