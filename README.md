# Effective TypeScript

This is the code sample repo for the _Effective TypeScript: 83 Specific Ways to Improve Your TypeScript_ (O'Reilly, May 2024). The book is available through:

- [DRM-Free eBook][ebook]

and others.

## Code Samples

Below you'll find a complete table of contents. Each item links to a page with its "Things to Remember" (a short summary of the item) and a listing of all its code samples. The code samples are accompanied by links to the [TypeScript playground][play]. They should produce the expected errors (and no others) and expected types.

Unless otherwise noted in a comment at the top of the code sample, the samples are run with TypeScript's `strict` setting. These were produced and checked using [literate-ts][] and TypeScript 5.4.5.
